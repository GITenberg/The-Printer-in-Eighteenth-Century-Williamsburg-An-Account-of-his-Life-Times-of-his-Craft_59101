<p>The paragraphs on this Page and the
next have been &#383;et in an eighteenth-century
Manner. The Type u&#383;ed is <i>Ca&#383;lon</i>, developed
in the early Part of the eighteenth Century
by <i>William Ca&#383;lon</i>, the greate&#64261; of the Engli&#383;h
Letter Founders. <i>Ca&#383;lon</i> in 1734 i&#383;&#383;ued his fir&#64261; Broad&#383;ide
Specimen Sheet of Type Faces cut at his Foundry during
the preceding Decade and a Half.</p>
<p>Although <i>Ca&#383;lon</i> is famous for the beautiful Type that
bears his Name, he de&#383;erves equal Credit for de&#383;igning &#383;ome
of the mo&#64261; hand&#383;ome Type Ornaments or &ldquo;Flowers&rdquo; ever
developed, before or after his Time. Such Type Flowers
had many U&#383;es&mdash;to embelli&#383;h Initial Letters at the Beginning
of a Chapter in a Book; as decorative Devices in a
&#383;ingle Row over a Type Heading &#64261;arting a new Page in a
Book; or over Headings each Time a new Subject was
introduced in a Text. Flowers were ca&#64261; to all the regular
Bodies of the Letter from the &#383;mall (<i>Nonpareil</i>) to the
large (<i>Great Primer</i>) Size. The Type Flowers u&#383;ed at the
Head of this Page, in the built-up Initial opening the fir&#64261;
Paragraph, and el&#383;ewhere in this Publication are reproduced
from original eighteenth-century Flowers excavated at the
Site of the Printing Office on <i>Duke of Glouce&#64261;er</i> Street in
<i>William&#383;burg</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_ii">ii</div>
<p>The longs &ldquo;s&rdquo; &#383;o evident in the&#383;e Paragraphs originated in
the <i>German</i> Hand Script. Early <i>German</i> Type Founders attempted
to reproduce Handwriting as clo&#383;ely as po&#383;&#383;ible.
In the Attempt the long &ldquo;s&rdquo; was evolved and was adopted
by the fir&#64261; <i>Engli&#383;h</i> Printers who learned their Trade from
the <i>Germans</i>. The long &ldquo;s&rdquo; remained in general U&#383;e until
about the Year 1800. It was always u&#383;ed at the Beginning
and in the Middle of a Word, but never to terminate a Word.
It can ea&#383;ily be recognized by the Fact of having only
half a Cro&#383;&#383;bar or none at all, whereas the Letter &ldquo;f&rdquo; has
a full Cro&#383;&#383;bar.</p>
<p>Ligatures, &#383;uch as ct, &#383;b, &#383;&#383;, &#383;i, &#383;&#383;i,
&#383;k, &#383;l, &#383;&#383;l, &#64261;, &#64257;, &#64259;, &#64256;,
&#64258;, &#64260;, were developed where a long &ldquo;s&rdquo; or an &ldquo;f&rdquo; overlapped
the following Letter. Ca&#64261;ing the two Characters together
avoided Damage to the overlapping Letter. Although &#383;ome
Ligatures have fallen into Di&#383;u&#383;e, the &#64257;, &#64259;,
&#64256;, &#64258;, and &#64260; are &#64261;ill common today.</p>
<p>Printers al&#383;o applied, through much of the Century, &#383;ome
Rules of Style which the modern Reader may find odd if not
awkward. For Example, they began all Nouns with a capital
Letter, thus di&#64261;ingui&#383;hing them from other Parts of Speech
&#383;uch as Adjectives, Verbs, &amp;c. In the &#383;ame Fa&#383;hion, they
capitalized Expre&#383;&#383;ions of particular Empha&#383;is, and Titles
of Honor and Eminence. The Names of Per&#383;ons and Places
they not only began with capital Letters but usually &#383;et
in <i>Italic</i> Type as well.</p>
<p>With the exception of certain <i>Scotti&#383;h</i> faces, small Capitals
were found in <i>Roman</i> Fonts of Type only. They were
employed to denote Empha&#383;is and Stre&#383;s, and were u&#383;ed
where the large Capitals would not fit, i.e., were too long.
Small Capitals were al&#383;o found in the fir&#64261; Word of the

<p>Strange though &#383;ome eighteenth-century Printing may appear
to today&rsquo;s Reader, there is one Point that &#383;hould be
&#64261;re&#383;&#383;ed. The Idio&#383;yncracies of a Type Page of the Period
were not merely Whims of individual Printers. They were
the Fa&#383;hion of the Time. When a Printer u&#383;ed &#383;everal Sizes
and Styles of Type on a Page, he was practicing what he and
his Contemporaries con&#383;idered to be good Typography.</p>

<p>If you had visited Williamsburg in the year
1743, say, and wanted to post a letter, buy
a book, a newspaper, or some writing paper,
or talk with an influential townsman, you
would have sought out the shop of William
Parks on Duke of Gloucester Street. Parks published the
<i>Virginia Gazette</i>, the first newspaper in the Virginia colony,
and his printing office served also as post office, bookshop,
stationery store, and general information center.</p>
<p>It was a place of many sounds and smells, and of much
activity. There you would find ink-smudged printer&rsquo;s devils
carefully sorting type under the watchful eye of the journeyman
printer, an accomplished craftsman and exacting
instructor. There you would also find the bookbinder
among his calfskins, marbled papers, glues, and presses.
And on the shelves, waiting for buyers, were pamphlets
and leatherbound volumes produced in the shop or imported
from England.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if you were lucky, you might see a postrider
burst in with London papers, rushed from a ship just arrived
from England. Then the printing shop was never livelier, for
the coming of news from abroad was an exciting event. At
such times, Printer Parks probably stopped what he was
doing, culled the choicest items from the London journals,
and made space for them on the front page of the next
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
issue of the <i>Gazette</i>. In a day or so, &ldquo;the freshest Advices,
Foreign and Domestick,&rdquo; would be on their way to Parks&rsquo;s
subscribers.</p>
<p>In the small (1,500 people) capital of Williamsburg, this
printing office was a nerve center through which news of
the vast outer world reached Virginians and, in turn, news
of His Majesty&rsquo;s largest American colony was conveyed to
other colonists and their homeland. By modern standards
it was a small printing shop. But in its effect on the people
of the Virginia colony, it was a powerful civilizing force.
As one of eight or nine printers of colonial newspapers,
moreover, William Parks, through his paper, kept the
people of the other colonies informed of the major events
that were taking place in the oldest and largest outpost of
Britain in America.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><i>THE PRINTING OFFICE TODAY</i></h3>
<p>For these reasons, Colonial Williamsburg has re-created
an eighteenth-century printing office as one of its series of
craft shops. Here the twentieth-century visitor will find
equipment such as was used two hundred years ago in similar
printing establishments on Duke of Gloucester Street operated
by Parks and later by William Hunter, Joseph Royle,
Alexander Purdie, John Dixon, William Hunter, Jr., William
Rind, and their successors. Here a master printer and his
apprentice, in the leather aprons and full-cut breeches of
the period, set by hand type closely resembling that which
Parks used.</p>
<p>To print its pages of hand-set type, the present Printing
Office has in operation three so-called &ldquo;English Common
Presses&rdquo; such as were built in the eighteenth century. One,
believed to have been made about 1750, was given to Colonial
Williamsburg by American Type Founders, Incorporated,
and the Rochester Institute of Technology. Of the
other two, one was designed by Ralph Green of Chicago after
a careful study of the handful of known eighteenth-century
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
presses in the United States, and both were built by Colonial
Williamsburg craftsmen.</p>
<p>In addition to the <i>Gazette</i>, tracts, pamphlets, and books
poured from Parks&rsquo;s press from the time he came to Williamsburg
about 1730 until he died on a voyage to England
in 1750. Surviving examples of his work reveal that he first
used Dutch type, which was followed by the more pleasing
face so &ldquo;friendly to the eye&rdquo; developed by William Caslon in
England. From matrices similar to Caslon&rsquo;s originals, his
successors in the type-founding business have cast the letters
used on the restored Williamsburg press. Parks&rsquo;s neat
printing and binding ornaments, so characteristic of the
classical-minded eighteenth century, have been similarly
reproduced. Eighteenth-century printers&rsquo; tools were made
from the careful drawings in Diderot&rsquo;s Encyclopedia and
from other sources.</p>
<p>To provide the kind of paper used by eighteenth-century
printers, Colonial Williamsburg began research in the 1930s
into the history of the town&rsquo;s only paper mill. Started by
Parks about 1743 with the help of his friend Benjamin
Franklin, the mill is believed to have outlived him. Examples
of its product were identified in 1936 in a German Bible
and a song book printed in Pennsylvania in 1763. Paper
that simulated the Parks paper was thereupon reproduced,
and was used in some of the work of the Printing Office and
in some Colonial Williamsburg books designed after examples
of Parks&rsquo;s work. Even the specks and spots of the
original Parks paper were imitated by a mixture of ground
flaxseed incorporated into the paper to insure the appearance
of authenticity.</p>
<p>Visitors to the Printing Office today may not see counterparts
of the postriders who brought mail to Parks&rsquo;s printing
shop and post office, but nearly everything else is there. As
in colonial days, the central figure is still the printer, bending
over his press and producing in a day&rsquo;s work what one
modern, mechanized press can turn out in a few minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h3 id="c4"><i>WILLIAMSBURG&rsquo;S FIRST PRINTER</i></h3>
<p>Although the colony of Virginia was founded in 1607, it
was not until the eighteenth century that printing was established
there. This delay was largely due to governmental
policy. In seventeenth-century England and her colonies,
freedom of the press was yet to be established. Even laws
passed by governing bodies could not without official permission
be printed and circulated for the benefit of citizens.
Until the Licensing Act of 1662 expired in 1695, the printing
trade in England was confined to London, the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, and to the English city of York.
The governors of the royal colony of Virginia felt empowered
to refuse permission for the establishment of printing until
the year 1690, after which printers were governed by royal
instructions which required a license and permission from
the governor as a prerequisite to setting up shop.</p>
<p>Sir William Berkeley, who was governor of Virginia from
1642 to 1652 and again from 1660 to 1677, summarized the
attitude of most officials of his day in his famous statement,
&ldquo;But, I thank God, there are no free schools nor printing,
and I hope we shall not have these hundred years; for learning
has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the
world, and printing has divulged them, and libels against the
best government. God keep us from both.&rdquo; (Berkeley was
in error: free schools <i>had</i> existed in Virginia, though printing
had not.)</p>
<p>In 1682, a few years after Berkeley wrote, a printer named
William Nuthead came to Jamestown, then the capital of
Virginia, proposing to serve the government by printing the
acts of the Assembly. He was ordered by the Governor&rsquo;s
Council to await royal approval. Several months later a
new governor arrived with an order from the king that &ldquo;no
person be permitted to use any press for printing upon any
occasion whatsoever.&rdquo; Nuthead moved to Maryland, and
printing in Virginia was delayed fifty years.</p>

<p>Before 1730, however, a more tolerant attitude had developed.
With the permission of Governor William Gooch,
the English-born William Parks moved that year from Annapolis
to Williamsburg, which had succeeded Jamestown as
the capital of Virginia in 1699. He was designated public
printer of Virginia, at an annual salary of &pound;120 a year,
eventually increased to &pound;280. Parks continued to print the
acts of the Virginia Assembly, which he had begun several
years before in Maryland, and soon advertised for subscriptions
for a proposed <i>Virginia Miscellany</i> &ldquo;at his House, near
the Capitol, in Williamsburg.&rdquo; Before the year was out he
had printed several works, at least five of which are known
by title. One of these is an ode to printing, <i>Typographia</i>, by
one &ldquo;J. Markland,&rdquo; which salutes Gooch for his encouragement
of printing. In the high-flown style of its day, the
ode concludes:</p>

</div>
<p>Parks was Williamsburg&rsquo;s most distinguished eighteenth-century
printer and probably its most successful. In the
annals of his craft in America he is ranked with Benjamin
Franklin and William Bradford, the foremost printers in
Pennsylvania and New York. Parks, like all of his brethren,
depended for his bread and butter on printing blank forms
(deeds, mortgages, bills, and the like), government work
(such as proclamations, forms, and laws), almanacs, and
other job work, but he helped establish in the American
colonies that dependence upon free and fair discussion of
issues in the newspapers which strengthened the concept of a
free press. He gave impetus to literature in a colony that
had lacked the local means for its encouragement. By his
example, he was partly responsible for the rash of journalistic
enterprise in pre-Revolutionary Williamsburg.</p>
<p>Parks&rsquo;s most influential act was his founding of the <i>Virginia
Gazette</i>, the first newspaper to be published in Virginia
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
and the second south of Maryland. Begun in 1736, this
weekly was the leader of a colorful succession of similarly
named sheets in Williamsburg and later in Richmond, to
which the Virginia government removed in 1780. And in
these <i>Gazettes</i>&mdash;in the 1770s published by as many as three
competing printers at a time&mdash;can be found a rich chronicle
of the events in the colonies leading to the American Revolution.
Important foreign and domestic occurrences were described
in dispatches&mdash;perhaps taken in some cases from
private correspondence&mdash;and in excerpts from other newspapers.
The editor rarely reported local happenings beyond
a brief mention of ship arrivals, marriages, deaths, fires,
and the like. He often printed legal notices and entire acts
of the Virginia Assembly, without comment. Fulsomely
phrased letters to the editor posed weighty questions of
government, science, or theology.</p>
<p>The modern reader will find the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> of 1736 to
1750 undramatic in its lack of headlines, pictures, and display
type. But the ingredients of human interest are there,
subtly in the note of controversy which gradually built up
to the Revolution, and emphatically in the advertisements,
which largely financed the <i>Gazette</i>. Many are the notices of
runaway slaves, strayed farm animals, husbands deserted
by wives, or blooded horses available for racing or breeding.
From the advertisements, also, the contemporary Virginia
reader could learn of the arrival of goods from London&mdash;articles
of fashion that were highly prized by Virginians
as evidence of their Englishness. In an early issue of the
<i>Gazette</i>, Parks states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Advertisement</span>, concerning <span class="sc">Advertisements</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">All</span> Persons who have Occasion to buy or sell Houses,
Lands, Goods, or Cattle; or have Servants or Slaves Runaway;
or have lost Horses, Cattle, &amp;c. or want to give any
Publick Notice; may have it advertis&rsquo;d in all these <i>Gazettes</i>
printed in one Week, for Three Shillings, and for Two Shillings
<i>per</i> Week for as many Weeks afterwards as they shall
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
order, by giving or sending their Directions to the <i>Printer</i>
hereof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, as these Papers will circulate (as speedily as possible)
not only all over This, but also the Neighbouring Colonies,
and will probably be read by some Thousands of People,
it is very likely they may have the desir&rsquo;d Effect; and it
is certainly the cheapest and most effectual Method that
can be taken, for Publishing any Thing of this Nature.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c5"><i>PRINTING IN AN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY</i></h3>
<p>William Parks&rsquo;s significant achievements seem even
greater if one understands the difficulties of operating a business
in the Williamsburg of 1730-1750. Because Virginia&rsquo;s
colonial prosperity was based on a one-crop economy&mdash;tobacco&mdash;little
&ldquo;ready money&rdquo; was in circulation within the
colony. The weed itself became a sort of currency. The
usual practice was for the plantation owner or the small
farmer to subsist on his produce and his credit until the crop
was harvested and shipped to English merchants, who from
the proceeds of its sale bought for the planter such articles as
he had directed. Because all American tobacco was transported
to Britain in British vessels, shipping space was
plentiful on the westward passage, and shipowners and
British merchants offered Virginia buyers cheap freight
rates on finished goods. Thus such English manufactures
as cloth, furniture, pewter, silver, and ceramics were sold to
Virginia planters and merchants.</p>
<p>The two-way trade between Virginia planters and British
merchants slowed down the development of a large Virginia
artisan group. Accordingly, local industry was limited in
eighteenth-century Virginia, even in an urban center such
as Williamsburg. Virginia craftsmen complained bitterly of
unpaid accounts, the necessity of accepting such &ldquo;country
pay&rdquo; as tobacco, corn, and beef, and the paucity of buyers
who offered ready money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>It is easy to understand why William Parks found relatively
few craftsmen in the Williamsburg of his day. Except
for a few trades such as cabinetmaking, blacksmithing, coopering,
wigmaking, tailoring, and shoemaking, the Virginia
capital was largely a community of taverns, townhouses,
and governmental institutions, and the colony itself was
overwhelmingly rural. There is no doubt that Virginia&rsquo;s
reliance on agriculture, a reliance approved by British mercantile
theory, resulted in an overdependence on the industry
of the mother country. We can thank the peculiarities
of Parks&rsquo;s situation&mdash;the inability of English printers to
satisfy Virginians&rsquo; desire for regional news, and the subsidy
Parks received as public printer&mdash;that his craft became
firmly established in the 1730s in Virginia. Indeed, it seems
clear that the prospect of becoming Virginia&rsquo;s public printer
was what lured Parks from Annapolis to Williamsburg in
the first place.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><i>PARKS&rsquo;S SUCCESSORS IN WILLIAMSBURG</i></h3>
<p>Altogether, Williamsburg had at least twelve master
printers and three separate printing locations or offices
during the colonial period. After Parks died on a voyage to
England, William Hunter, the man whom he had left in
charge, bought the business. Publication of the <i>Virginia
Gazette</i> continued, and Hunter became public printer and
postmaster. In the latter capacity he worked in close association
with an astute Philadelphia printer, Benjamin
Franklin, with whom he served jointly as deputy postmaster-general
for all the colonies. Hunter printed in 1754
the first published writing of George Washington, entitled
<i>The Journal of Major George Washington, sent by the Hon.
Robert Dinwiddie, Esq; His Majesty&rsquo;s Lieutenant-Governor,
and Commander in Chief of Virginia, to the Commandant of
the French Forces on Ohio....</i></p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>After Hunter&rsquo;s death in 1761, the printing office had a
succession of owners and operators. As tension increased
between Great Britain and her American colonies, especially
after the adoption of the Stamp Act in 1765, the relation of
public printer to government became more difficult. The
printer faced the necessity of maintaining good relations
with both loyalist and patriot elements in the House of Burgesses.
One loyalist reader of the <i>Gazette</i>, the Reverend John
Camm, complained in the early 1760s that Hunter&rsquo;s successor,
Joseph Royle, refused to publish Camm&rsquo;s pamphlet
arguing the cause of Church of England clergymen because
of its &ldquo;Satyrical Touches upon the Late Assembly.&rdquo; On the
other hand, certain patriot members criticized Royle in the
columns of the <i>Maryland Gazette</i> for allegedly refusing to
print their criticisms of local government. The printer was
caught between fires.</p>
<p>Criticism of the <i>Gazette</i> continued after Royle died in
January 1766, and Alexander Purdie, a Scotsman, took over
the business. In what is thought to have been his first issue,
Purdie announced that &ldquo;the press shall likewise be as free as
any Gentleman can wish, or desire; and I crave the countenance
and favour of the publick no longer than my conduct
may appear to merit their approbation.&rdquo; Later the same
month, Purdie wrote, &ldquo;As I understand it is thought by some
that I have neglected, or refused, to publish the account of a
late transaction at Hobb&rsquo;s Hole [Tappahannock], this is to
assure the publick ... that I never saw the same, nor was it
ever offered to me to publish, otherwise it would have seen
the light before this time: For I do now, as I have heretofore
declared, that my press shall be as free as any Gentleman can
wish or desire; that is, as free as any publick press upon the
continent.&rdquo; In 1775, after Purdie established another <i>Virginia
Gazette</i>, his paper bore the appealing motto &ldquo;Always
for Liberty, and the Publick Good.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c7"><i>TOWARD A FREE PRESS</i></h3>
<p>In spite of Purdie&rsquo;s efforts, the trend was toward a competitive
press. A rival <i>Virginia Gazette</i> was set up in Williamsburg
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
in 1766 by William Rind, a Maryland printer who
was more sympathetic to the protesting colonists than Royle
and Purdie were thought to be. The motto of his paper
cannily proclaimed &ldquo;Open to all Parties but influenced by
None.&rdquo; Governor Francis Fauquier at this time reported to
the British Board of Trade: &ldquo;The late printer to the Colony
[Royle] is dead, and as the press was then thought to be too
complaisant to me, some of the hot Burgesses invited a
printer [Rind] from Maryland. Upon which the foreman
[Purdie] to the late printer, who is also a candidate for the
place, has taken up the newspaper again in order to make
interest with the Burgesses.&rdquo; Jefferson, who in 1766 was
completing his study of law, and was a friend and admirer of
Fauquier&rsquo;s, recalled later: &ldquo;We had but one press, and that
having the whole business of the government, and no competitor
for public favor, nothing disagreeable to the governor
could be got into it. We procured Rind to come from Maryland
to publish a free paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hot-spirited Rind was elected public printer by the
House of Burgesses. However, the job being too much for
one printer alone, the Assembly in 1769 authorized both <i>Gazette</i>
publishers, Rind and Purdie, to print a large volume
containing the Acts of Assembly then in force. Rind continued
in office until his death in 1773 when his widow,
Clementina Rind, took over the business as Virginia&rsquo;s first
woman printer.</p>
<p>The number of weekly newspapers in Williamsburg increased
again in 1775 when Purdie, who had taken John
Dixon into his business nine years before, withdrew in favor
of William Hunter, Jr., the son of William Parks&rsquo;s successor,
and established his own <i>Virginia Gazette</i>. When the Revolution
broke in 1776, Williamsburg thus had three newspapers,
each called the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>. Rind&rsquo;s <i>Gazette</i> expired by
1777, after a succession of managers, and Purdie&rsquo;s (which
was continued after his death in 1779 by Clarkson and
Davis) ceased publication in 1780. Dixon formed a new
partnership with Thomas Nicolson in 1779 after William
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Hunter, Jr., had joined the British forces. Their newspaper
was called the <i>Phoenix Gazette and Williamsburg
Intelligencer</i>, but it expired the following year when these
printers followed the seat of government to establish
Richmond&rsquo;s first press.</p>
<p>So pronounced was the decline in Williamsburg&rsquo;s fortunes
that from the year of the government&rsquo;s removal until forty-four
years later, in 1824, Williamsburg had no newspaper.
Old copies of the three <i>Gazettes</i> were treasured reminders of
the town&rsquo;s past glory. The name, <i>Virginia Gazette</i>, and
some of the tradition of Parks&rsquo;s skill were remembered, but
little was done to perpetuate them until the late Dr. W. A. R.
Goodwin in 1926 invited Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to
restore Williamsburg. As a by-product of that movement,
the proud masthead of William Parks&rsquo;s original <i>Virginia
Gazette</i> was revived in 1930 by the late Joseph A. Osborne
and his family. Likewise, in the realm of paper manufacture,
typography, book production, and bookbinding, Colonial
Williamsburg has revived the workmanship of William
Parks and his confreres. In such publications as <i>The
Williamsburg Art of Cookery, or, Accomplish&rsquo;d Gentlewoman&rsquo;s
Companion</i>, published in 1938, and <i>A Brief &amp; True Report
concerning Williamsburg in Virginia</i>, first published in 1935,
Colonial Williamsburg emulated type, paper, format, and
binding of similar volumes from Parks&rsquo;s press. And at its
Printing Office, it has sought to recapture the manner and
mood of a colonial printing shop as a part of its program to
teach twentieth-century Americans more about the lives and
ideas of their pre-Revolutionary ancestors.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><i>TECHNIQUES OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PRINTING</i></h3>
<p>In considering the craft of printing, it is important to remember
that the western world has enjoyed the invention of
movable type only since the middle of the fifteenth century.
For several centuries thereafter, the new development was
regarded with suspicion by church and state, which, as we
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
have seen, feared the freedom of thought that would ensue
if reading matter were readily available. Even in the eighteenth
century, an era of enlightenment, printing was
suspect.</p>
<p>An equally difficult obstacle facing the colonial printer
was the cost of his press, his type, his paper, and his equipment.
Eighteenth-century industry was largely home operated,
based on the capital and ingenuity of one family. Yet
the cost of equipping even the modest one- or two-press
shops of eighteenth-century America was a burden for most
people of the working class. In his famous <i>Autobiography</i>,
Benjamin Franklin gives a vivid picture of the immense
labor and thought that lay between a printer&rsquo;s apprenticeship
and ownership. To reach the level of success that
Franklin and Parks achieved required not only skill but
unusual industry and shrewdness.</p>
<p>Eighteenth-century appraisals of several printing houses
indicate an average value of &pound;100 to &pound;125 currency. We
may suppose that William Parks set up shop in Williamsburg
in 1730 on some such scale as this, adding type and other
equipment to the value of &pound;359 Virginia currency or &pound;288
sterling at the time his equipment was sold to William
Hunter in 1751. Undoubtedly Parks&rsquo;s three presses and his
type constituted his chief equipment. The presses presumably
were of the English common sort, which had then been
in standard use in the British Isles for nearly one hundred
years. The type was an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony,
the letters having been cast in Holland or England, and
probably was valued at more than the rest of Parks&rsquo;s
facilities together. For the rest, equipment consisted of such
printers&rsquo; staples as poles for drying paper, &ldquo;shooting sticks,&rdquo;
quoins, planes, type cases, type racks, composing sticks, lye
troughs, wetting troughs, and other paraphernalia. For
bookbinding the printer needed other instruments, some of
which could be made in Williamsburg. The majority of the
tools, however, were imported from Great Britain or Holland.</p>

<p>As he received each font or size of type, the colonial printer
would distribute it in a set of four wooden trays, two for
Roman type and two for italic. These contained partitions
for each &ldquo;character,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sort,&rdquo; as the letters and numerals
were called. Such partitions varied in size depending on the
frequency of use of each letter or numeral, and they were so
placed as to permit the printer to assemble type with a minimum
of movement. (Because capital letters are usually
arranged in the upper two cases and small letters in the
lower two, printers traditionally refer to them as &ldquo;upper
case&rdquo; or &ldquo;lower case,&rdquo; respectively.)</p>
<p>In setting a page of printed matter the colonial printer
rapidly plucked the necessary characters, one by one, from
their compartments in the upper and lower cases. He placed
them, with proper spacing, in a &ldquo;composing stick&rdquo; set to the
proper length of line. When the stick was full he transferred
the type to a shallow wooden tray called a &ldquo;galley.&rdquo; Having
assembled in the galley enough type to form a page, the
printer &ldquo;tied it off,&rdquo; i.e., bound a piece of string tightly
around the whole mass. Then he could slide the assembled
page off the galley onto the surface of the &ldquo;imposing stone,&rdquo;
a flat marble working surface. Such transfers of type&mdash;especially
from composing stick to galley&mdash;were often
attended with accidents. One of the printer&rsquo;s commoner
frustrations was to have a stick, a galley, or even a whole
page form of type dropped and &ldquo;pied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the imposing stone a rectangular wrought-iron frame
or &ldquo;chase&rdquo; was then placed around the type, and the finished
page was locked into place with wooden blocks and wedges
called &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; and &ldquo;quoins.&rdquo; After being locked, it
could be picked up and moved to the printing press without
danger of the type falling out of place.</p>
<p>The eighteenth-century printer used paper made by hand
from linen rags, importing it from Great Britain in the earlier
years while domestic mills were gradually developing. Because
such paper was uneven in texture and poorly sized,
it was dampened before being put on the press to provide a
more pliant working surface. For ink, Parks and his contemporaries
used a combination of lampblack and varnish,
which remain the chief constituents of printer&rsquo;s ink today.
Lampblack was obtained by burning various materials and
collecting the carbon in flues, while varnish was made of
pine resin boiled in linseed oil until a clear liquid resulted.
Most printers &ldquo;rubbed&rdquo; or mixed the lampblack and varnish
thoroughly. If the mixture was too thick, it could be
thinned with linseed oil or whale oil. If red ink was desired
for two-color printing, vermilion could be substituted for
lampblack.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Once the printer or his apprentices had set the type, pulled
a proof, &ldquo;made up&rdquo; the type into pages with the proper
spacing and ornaments, and then locked it into forms by
means of furniture and quoins, he placed his form on the
press and adjusted it to get the most even impression. Then
he was ready to begin the actual process of printing. Whereas
printing is commonly done today by automatic presses, fed
with paper either mechanically or by hand, it had to be done
one sheet at a time in the eighteenth century. Two men
usually worked the press, and the printing of a single impression
required approximately a dozen different manual
operations.</p>
<p>To ink his press, preparatory to printing, the &ldquo;beater&rdquo;
spread the necessary amount of ink on his mixing block
and rubbed it to an even consistency&mdash;that of stiff molasses&mdash;with
a wooden brayer. With two leather-covered balls
attached to wooden handles, he then collected ink from the
stone, beat the &ldquo;ink balls&rdquo; together to distribute the sticky
fluid over their surfaces, and then with a rapid rocking and
rolling motion, transferred it onto the type. Then the
&ldquo;puller&rdquo; placed his paper on a skin-covered wooden frame
called a tympan and folded over it another light covered
frame, called a frisket. These two frames in turn folded
down onto the bed of the press, where the type was locked
in its iron form or chase.</p>
<p>The actual impression was made by rolling the bed of the
press, complete with folded tympan and frisket, beneath
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the platen, which was suspended from a large metal screw.
By applying the force of the screw, the puller pressed the
paper firmly against the inked type. The size of the printed
matter might vary from a small bookplate or lottery ticket
to a sheet twelve by eighteen inches, which was roughly the
page size of Purdie and Dixon&rsquo;s <i>Virginia Gazette</i> of 1759.
Whatever the dimension, the beater had to ink his form
and the puller had to close and open his press again each
time a surface was printed. Since the platen was so small,
only one-half of a two-page wide newspaper could be printed
at a time on the early press, and a repeat operation was
required to complete one side of the sheet. Thus the press
was sometimes called a &ldquo;two-pull&rdquo; press.</p>
<p>Two experienced pressmen, working at full speed, could
turn out a &ldquo;token&rdquo; or 240 printed sheets (with two pulls and
on one side only) per hour. Such a speed could not long be
maintained; the practical output was closer to 200 sheets
per hour. But wages were low, working hours were long,
and the printer could keep his force on the job until the
work was done.</p>
<h3 id="c9"><i>THE PRINTER AND HIS MEN</i></h3>
<p>Because of its close association with literature, the craft of
printing has generally attracted a more intellectual type of
craftsman and enjoyed a prestige greater than most others.
Over the centuries, master printers have jealously enforced
the standards of their predecessors, insisting today, as in the
eighteenth century, on a long apprenticeship for learners.
Upon completion of the stipulated learning period and
achievement of the required proficiency, the apprentice then,
as now, became a journeyman. A mature and experienced
worker at this stage, he was qualified to take his leave of his
master, if he desired, and to practice his craft where he
wished. When such a printer engaged in work for himself
and employed others, he became a master printer.</p>
<p>The apprentice system was in some respects a great boon
to eighteenth-century craftsmen, for it provided cheap labor
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
in return only for training and the necessities of life. Each
master took into his establishment a number of youngsters,
hoping that some might prove of &ldquo;bright genius and good
disposition.&rdquo; To these he obligated himself to provide food,
shelter, and in most cases, clothing. The apprentice thereupon
became a member of the printer&rsquo;s household, performing
any chores assigned to him in the home, shop, or printing
office. But although apprentice labor was cheap, it was
unskilled and often inept. Apprenticeships were frequently
broken off, and only the relatively few youths who were
suited for the work and desirous of learning the &ldquo;art and
mystery&rdquo; of the craft kept at it until accepted as journeymen
at the age of twenty-one.</p>
<p>Many accounts have come down to us of the abuses as
well as the uses of the apprentice system. Runaways were
frequent, as attested by advertisements such as the one
William Parks ran in the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> in 1745 for the
return of a &ldquo;smooth-tongued&rdquo; apprentice &ldquo;who makes
Locks, and is dexterous at picking them.&rdquo; Sometimes mere
children were apprenticed by poorer families who were unable
to support them. Isaiah Thomas, a New England
printer, was indentured at the age of six. In return for his
training and keep, he bound himself to avoid drunkenness
and carnal pursuits and to serve his master until he became
twenty-one. However, the majority of apprentices were
indentured at fourteen, to serve until they reached man&rsquo;s
estate.</p>
<p>The apprentice system largely supplied the printer&rsquo;s need
for unskilled labor, but he could supplement it with slaves or
with indentured servants. The latter were usually young
Englishmen of the lower classes who had emigrated to America
and who had bound themselves to a term of labor in
return for their voyage. Unlike apprentices, however, they
were not required to be taught to print.</p>
<p>Trained, or journeymen, printers were scarce in colonial
times, and they seem to have been often on the go. Even
master printers moved about frequently. William Parks
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
had engaged in printing in three English towns and in Annapolis
before coming to Williamsburg in 1730. William Rind,
who established his paper in Williamsburg in 1766, came
there from Annapolis. Of Williamsburg&rsquo;s other master
printers and journeymen, some were locally trained but
others had been apprenticed in England.</p>
<h3 id="c10"><i>A NOTE ON THE PRINTING OFFICE</i></h3>
<p>Although the Printing Office of Colonial Williamsburg
does not attempt precisely to re-create any particular
colonial printing shop, it does represent the craft as it was
practiced in the mid-1700s. Here the twentieth-century
American is invited to pause and look about him. Perhaps,
if he is in a receptive mood, he may sense the spirit of the
talented William Parks, keeping a watchful eye over apprentices
and journeymen while type is set, presses are inked,
and impressions are pulled from the press. Perhaps he can
discern some Virginia planter making his way to Parks&rsquo;s
bookshelf, to buy Allestree&rsquo;s <i>The Whole Duty of Man</i> or
Bayly&rsquo;s <i>The Practice of Piety</i> to take with him to his plantation
and read during winter evenings.</p>
<p>Entering the Printing Office, the visitor finds himself in
a typical Williamsburg structure of the eighteenth century.
Fireplaces on each floor of the shop warm the workers in
cold weather and dry the printed sheets of paper hung on
overhead racks. Many-paned windows provide most of the
shop&rsquo;s illumination during daylight hours, and also a place&mdash;in
the bays on Duke of Gloucester Street&mdash;for the printer
to post signs and samples of his work. At night and on dark
days candelabra hanging from the ceiling and tin sconces
against the walls hold candles whose smoky flames blacken
the plaster as they help to light the working areas.</p>
<p>On the street floor are the post office, stationery, and bookselling
counter&mdash;one of the important areas of the normal
colonial printing office, since it combined three of the most
important sidelines. Along with the shelves of books for
sale, some bound in leather and some in temporary paper
covers, there is a mail rack with slots for letters and newspapers.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>On the same floor is the printer&rsquo;s &ldquo;counting room&rdquo; or
what would nowadays be called his &ldquo;accounting department.&rdquo;
Here he kept the numerous business records called
for by the cumbersome bookkeeping systems of that day,
penned business letters, and perhaps wrote out in longhand
the material he intended for publication in the <i>Virginia
Gazette</i>. Eighteenth-century printers often engaged in several
other businesses at the same time&mdash;importing goods of
almost any kind, selling farm products on commission, and
trying anything that might turn a penny.</p>
<p>Excavation of the Printing Office site and careful study
of the surviving eighteenth-century foundations and brick
flooring gave evidence&mdash;in the form of reinforced footings&mdash;as
to where at least one press may have stood. This was in
the lower floor of the building, where again today the shop&rsquo;s
printing operation is concentrated. There the three presses
mentioned earlier occupy the center of the room, all of them
in working order. Large racks for the storage of type line
the wall, surmounted by open, slanting cases of type in current
use. The cases contain a complete set of Caslon letters,
from the diminutive Nonpareil (6-point) to Six Line Pica
(72-point), which is one inch tall. Usually the printer employs
the Pica (12-point) and English (14-point) sizes,
which were customarily used in colonial times. He and his
colleagues identified type sizes by name only; since the
present point system was not in use then.</p>
<p>Printer&rsquo;s ink and its ingredients&mdash;varnish, lampblack or
vermilion, and linseed oil&mdash;are kept in saltglaze jugs. Other
vessels contain drinking water, and the wetting trough is
filled, ready for dampening paper before printing. On the
floor, weighted boards atop stacks of wetted paper keep the
sheets from curling as the dampness permeates evenly
throughout the pile.</p>

<p>In the small back shop, a separate building, the similarly

bookbinder of today, working with the tools and methods
of his eighteenth-century predecessors, sews together the
printed and folded signatures that make a book, binds them
in boards, and covers the boards&mdash;perhaps in elegantly decorated
leather bindings. He may use marbled paper of his
own making for end-papers or on the outer covers of smaller
books. For tooling and lettering the cover he has a collection
of brass dies, some of which are designed from lettering
stamps excavated in the vicinity of his&mdash;and William Parks&rsquo;s
workshop.</p>
<h3 id="c11"><i>OUR PRINTING HERITAGE</i></h3>
<p>From the crude presses of Williamsburg came an ingredient
essential to the movement toward American self-government
and independence&mdash;the political pamphlet. In the
world of the eighteenth century, devoid of radio, television,
or the bulky daily paper, the substance of political debate
came from such pamphlets. It was also an era which took
its political philosophy seriously, and the author of a pamphlet
could count on wide readership among the planter-aristocrats
who controlled the machinery of government.
Williamsburg, as the colony&rsquo;s capital and its political and
intellectual center, was the obvious city to lend its imprint
to the speculations of Virginia&rsquo;s pamphleteers.</p>
<p>One of the most significant early tracts was Richard
Bland&rsquo;s <i>An Inquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies</i>,
printed by Alexander Purdie in March 1766. Writing in
the aftermath of the previous year&rsquo;s fiery Stamp Tax debates,
Bland vigorously proclaimed his belief in Locke&rsquo;s
doctrines of natural rights and natural law. Reprinted in
London, Bland&rsquo;s tract was evidence of the mounting sentiment
for self-rule in the colonies. Bland&rsquo;s <i>Inquiry</i> was also a
memorial to its author, a man who devoted much of his life
to public service. An aged delegate to Virginia&rsquo;s first state
legislature in October 1776, Bland collapsed in the Williamsburg
streets on his way to a session, and died hours later in
the home of his friend, John Tazewell.</p>

<p>The most important pamphlet printed in Williamsburg
was <i>A Summary View of the Rights of British America</i>, from
the pen of Thomas Jefferson. Lying ill up-country in August
of 1774, when Virginia&rsquo;s legislators were convened in
Williamsburg to send off delegates for the First Continental
Congress, Jefferson wrote his tract to suggest instructions
that might guide these delegates at Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The <i>Summary View</i> was read aloud by Peyton Randolph
in his home on Market Square to a room filled with Virginia
patriots. It was too radical for some, but moving to all. It
was at once set in type by Clementina Rind, Williamsburg&rsquo;s
only woman printer. Among the first to purchase a copy
was George Washington, who noted in his diary that it cost
him three shillings ninepence. The pamphlet was reprinted
in Philadelphia and London and has been described as second
only to the Declaration of Independence in charting the
American course toward independence. John Adams of
Massachusetts testified that the <i>Summary View</i> gave Jefferson
&ldquo;the reputation of a masterly pen&rdquo; among Congress delegates
in 1776 and won for the Virginian his assignment to
draft the Declaration.</p>
<p>To the Williamsburg printer we owe a word of thanks for
the important part that he has played in the affairs of this
early Virginia capital&mdash;affairs that had notable influence
on the course of American history. Since civilization began,
the communication of ideas has largely depended upon the
written word. The eighteenth-century printers of Williamsburg&mdash;and
all America&mdash;served that need at a time of great
moment, when the destiny of the emerging ideals of political
democracy, free speech, a free press, and freedom of conscience
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
was uncertain. They had the privilege of enlisting
their craftsmanship in the service of freedom, peace, and
plenty, goals that continue to beckon mankind.</p>
<p>To the printer&rsquo;s art, then, we wholeheartedly render the
tribute which J. Markland pronounced in <i>Typographia</i>, in
1730, as he saluted Governor Gooch and Printer Parks for
giving Virginia its first press:</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
